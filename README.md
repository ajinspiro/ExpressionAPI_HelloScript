<p>
	This is an auxilary addition to Praseed Pai KT's original work “<a href="https://github.com/praseedpai/HelloScript_files">HelloScript_files</a>” in which he has curated a set of programs from numerous programming languages. 
  The reader can go through these programs and find themselfs learning the most commonly used programming constructs in each of those languages fast. 
  ExpressionAPI_HelloScript takes that idea and applies it to Expression API of C#. 
  I have used some of the programs in Mr. Pai's C# section of HelloScript_files and wrote them down in C# Expression API for learning Expression API myself.
  A reader may use the programs in this repository to get up and running with C# Expression API fast.
